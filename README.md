One day, little Tim was in math class, daydreaming. The teacher came over and asked, "Tim, what’s 3 plus 3?" Tim, startled, quickly said, "6!" The teacher nodded, "Good. Now, what’s 5 plus 5?" Tim thought for a moment and replied, "Teacher, can't you do such an easy problem yourself?" The whole class burst out laughing. The teacher, shaking her head, said, "I'm testing you, not myself." Tim blinked and said, "Well, next time I'll test you, so you can learn something too!" The teacher couldn’t help but laugh.
